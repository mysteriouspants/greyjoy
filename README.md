# Greyjoy Octopress Theme

A simple white and grey colored theme for Octopress. Named after the messed up Theon Greyjoy.

## Install

```
$ cd .themes
$ git clone git://github.com/rezajatnika/greyjoy.git
$ rake install[greyjoy]
$ rake generate
```

## Notes & Issues
The sass files still messed up, hope I will clean it later.
